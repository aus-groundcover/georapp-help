RaPP Map works best on a laptop, desktop, or tablet. It can be used on some mobile phones however the smaller screen may change the appearance of the interface and remove some functionality.  

Help videos are available in the channel [https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7s3CQngiHpmkHHBlNfzmTw](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7s3CQngiHpmkHHBlNfzmTw).

## Layout of RaPP Map  

RaPP map has two main parts: the map viewer (Right hand side), and the workbench (navigation pane - Left hand side):  

1. Map viewer: view the data in the display on the right. There are tools to navigate around the map, change the background map, and share what you see.  
1. Workbench (navigation pane): the data and analysis menu on the left lets you search for locations, choose layers to view, and analyse and find reports.
