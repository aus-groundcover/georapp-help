# Introduction 

Welcome to the help for RaPP Map – the online Rangelands and Pasture Productivity Map tool.  

## What does RaPP Map do? 

Nationally consistent and regularly updated ground cover information is a critical indicator for environmental targets related to soil erosion and land management in Australia. Ground cover or vegetation cover reduces soil erosion, increases water infiltration, enables carbon sequestration, and contributes to agricultural production of food and fibre. 

This tool unlocks monthly ground cover reporting for Australia to a location or region. With this tool you can:   

- Find your place 
- Bring in your own boundary file 
- Explore the proportion of brown, green, and total vegetation, and bare soil  
- Find out which areas are protected from soil erosion  
- Track vegetation cover every month using a time series 
- Find areas where cover is frequently low 
- See how cover this month compares with previous years using anomaly and decile maps 
- View contextual layers such as land use, forests, slope, soils, water observations, and roads  
- View reports for your region by land use and forest cover class   
- Set targets for area protected from wind and or water erosion 
- Report progress against targets. 

RaPP Map is built on a platform called [Terria™](https://www.csiro.au/en/research/technology-space/data/terria), developed by CSIRO Data61. The Terria platform for web-based spatial data visualisation and analytics provides access to large numbers of spatial data services directly from the original data custodian and allows users to search, explore, share and add to maps. There are several other maps also built on this platform. 

## Who can use RaPP map? 

This tool is for decision makers interested in natural resource management. This tool is best suited to reporting for Australia and its regions such as Natural Resource Management (NRM) Regions or Local Government Areas (LGAs), and large properties with paddocks or areas with similar management covering over 200 Hectares. RaPP map features monthly fractional vegetation cover from MODIS at 500 metre resolution. This regular information indicates areas at risk of wind and water (hillslope) erosion and supports strategic decision making.  

## What’s new in Version 8 - 2022?  

The online tool RaPP map was upgraded from Version 7 to Version 8 in July 2022. This change brought the functionality of RaPP map in line with other Terria supported products such as [National Map](https://nationalmap.gov.au/). Access to the online tool and most functions continue to work as they did in Version 7. Some input data has also been updated.
